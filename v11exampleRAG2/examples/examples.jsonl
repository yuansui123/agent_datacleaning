In the region (~1.2–1.6 s and again ~2.2–2.3 s), fast_ripple, ripple, high_gamma, mid_gamma, and low_gamma bands show sharply increased power, appearing as dense vertical streaks. This reflects brief, non-phase-locked, high-frequency activity across multiple bands.", "image_path": "C:\\Users\\yuans\\Desktop\\Mayo_dataset\\agent_datacleaning\\v10exampleRAG\\examples\\noise_power_density_matrix_hilbert.png", "extra": {}}
{"id": "timeseries_example_01", "label": "noise", "description": "Single-channel time series containing two high-variance, high-amplitude bursts. The first burst occurs around 1.3–1.7 s and appears as dense, rapid oscillations with larger peak-to-peak amplitude compared to the surrounding signal. The second burst appears around 2.7–3.1 s, showing similarly irregular, fast fluctuations. Both segments stand out visually as noisy, high-energy epochs embedded within slower background oscillations.", "image_path": "C:\\Users\\yuans\\Desktop\\Mayo_dataset\\agent_datacleaning\\v10exampleRAG\\examples\\noise_time_series.png", "extra": {}}
{"id": "power_density_matrix_example_02", "label": "pathology", "description": "Power density matrix showing a focal pathological burst around 1.50 s. The event appears as a bright, high-intensity vertical column spanning multiple frequency bands. Fast_ripple, ripple, high_gamma, and mid_gamma exhibit sharply elevated power, forming a dense broadband activation. Simultaneously, the temporal evolution plots show a coordinated surge across low_gamma, mid_gamma, high_gamma, ripple, and fast_ripple, indicating a transient high-energy, non-stationary neural event. This burst stands out distinctly from surrounding baseline activity and suggests a short-duration pathological discharge.", "image_path": "C:\\Users\\yuans\\Desktop\\Mayo_dataset\\agent_datacleaning\\v10exampleRAG\\examples\\pathology_power_density_matrix_hilbert.png", "extra": {}}
{"id": "timeseries_example_02", "label": "pathology", "description": "Single-channel time series showing a sudden pathological transient around 1.45–1.60 s. The event consists of a rapid, large-amplitude negative deflection followed by an equally abrupt rebound toward positive values. This produces a sharp, high-slope waveform with steep downward and upward transitions, visually distinct from the surrounding slower oscillations. The morphology resembles a transient pathological discharge characterized by high amplitude, high variance, and brief duration.", "image_path": "C:\\Users\\yuans\\Desktop\\Mayo_dataset\\agent_datacleaning\\v10exampleRAG\\examples\\pathology_time_series.png", "extra": {}}
{"id": "power_density_matrix_example_03", "label": "powerline", "description": "Power density matrix and temporal evolution plots showing a time series heavily contaminated by persistent 60 Hz line noise. In the Hilbert power matrix, the 'powerline_60hz' band is continuously bright along the full time axis, indicating sustained high power at 60 Hz. The high_gamma and mid_gamma bands also show elevated streaking consistent with harmonic bleed-through. In the temporal evolution plot, the 60 Hz power trace remains abnormally high and relatively flat, while other bands appear modulated by the noise. The overall pattern reflects broadband pollution driven by strong electrical interference rather than physiological activity.", "image_path": "C:\\Users\\yuans\\Desktop\\Mayo_dataset\\agent_datacleaning\\v10exampleRAG\\examples\\powerline_power_density_matrix_hilbert.png", "extra": {}}
{"id": "timeseries_example_03", "label": "powerline", "description": "Single-channel time series dominated by dense high-frequency oscillations throughout the entire 0–3 s window. The waveform shows tightly packed, rapid fluctuations with large peak-to-peak amplitude, producing a thick, saturated appearance. A slow amplitude envelope is visible underneath, but the signal is overwhelmingly masked by broadband high-frequency activity. The overall pattern is characteristic of strong high-frequency contamination, such as EMG noise or electrical interference, rather than physiological neural activity.", "image_path": "C:\\Users\\yuans\\Desktop\\Mayo_dataset\\agent_datacleaning\\v10exampleRAG\\examples\\powerline_time_series.png", "extra": {}}
